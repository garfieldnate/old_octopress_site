title: "10 Things I Love and Hate About Japan"
---

My wife and I recently read some interesting posts on Tofugu: 10 awesome things about Japan, 10 horrible things about Japan. I agree and disagree with some, and it's an interesting topic so here are my thoughts:

awesome: food

awesome: peace-loving

I think the most American thing may just be having a strong opinion.

omoiyari

Nature-loving; no arguments; politics not that fighty; no war;

suck: financial paperwork

awesome: immigration (at least for Americans)

awesome: medical (so far)

suck: work culture

suck: communications technology
