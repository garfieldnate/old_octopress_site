title: "Thoughts on Language Learning"
---

You know what they don't train you on in language class?

All of the practicalities, the bad input, the creative usage, the spoonerisms, the crying or laughing, the bus riding by (Nakama actually did that one), the accents. The mumblers. The quiets.

For the most part its a very left-brained endeavor. I realized when reading pragmatic thinking and learning that I've been being entirely too L-mode about japanese. Yes, L-mode is the main language one, but I don't think it does all of the processing. I think it does logic and such, but I think R-mode's asynchronous pattern matching is incredibly important. Instead of talking and thinking, "what was that? Oh, dang, I made a grammar/pronunciation mistake!" and being way to precise about it, I need to relax and just communicate. That's the point after all. I can't go back and cross out something I said, and there's way too much brain power that gets wasted on worrying about current performance. My performance is fine! Just communicate.

Anyway. What is the L/R usage for language like, anyway? Im sure it's not just L. Maybe the R does a bunch on the front end getting words, the L does syntactic kumitateruing, and the R does some more phrase pattern matching. Are there any NLP systems like that? The one from Percy Liang seems to be on the right path.

How can we exercise R problems for language learning? Well, Nakama did that bus drives by while speaking thing. How about exercises where we try to guess the meanings of words that a speaker made up? Meh, you know, people already do that stuff. I think just a little education is fine. Like that professional POS taggers can only agree on 98% of the tags, so the last 2% is ambiguous or noise. Or the rate of spoonerisms in conversation, and what kind of spoonerisms are common for the given language (that would be really cool to learn!). How many new vocab do adults learn on a daily basis?

I've always worked hard on grammar and pronunciation, but that's not the magic bullet. *Experience* is.

Note: Read Black Swan. It's called the platonic fold.
